# MovieCollector-iOS
Track which movies you've seen and want to watch as two lists. See stats on those lists. Uses TheMovieDB API

Still in development to 1.0

Should you want to run for yourself you will need to create a file to link to TheMovieDB api and an access key. You can get your key by setting up an account over on their site.


-------------

With the MovieDB adding Runtime per episode my intial idea of an app is coming back. Will continue keeping the movie side, but also adding a tv show side to track time left in a show you're binging
